- OPTIONAL: README creation (done)

- Fix Overfittin issue by literature review and technqniues used to address the overfitting.. (inprogress)

- This should be studied and along with implementation of automatic hyperparameters optimizations (inprogress)
- comprehensive literature review on the chest x-ray dataset, including methods, results, and techniques used. (pending)
- try to come up with a state of the art image-uderstanding architecutre, optimize hyperparameters, dataset correction using mlops tools, and 
  leraning data augmentations for performance improvments, so that the given model outperform other x-ray trained models on the same dataset.
