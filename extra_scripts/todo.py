Tasks and their status 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:
- GradCAM (done)

- RESULTS EVALUATION (done)

- OPTIONAL: README creation (done)

- Fix Overfittin issue by literature review and technqniues used to address the overfitting.. (inprogress)

- This should be studied and along with implementation of automatic hyperparameters optimizations (inprogress)

- Comprehensive literature review on the chest x-ray dataset, including methods, results, and techniques used. (pending)

- Try to come up with a state of the art image-uderstanding architecutre, optimize hyperparameters, dataset correction using mlops tools, and 
  leraning data augmentations for performance improvments, so that the given model outperform other x-ray trained models on the same dataset.

- Additionally try other Grad-CAM techniques for localization, such as PyTorch Grad-CAM or other state of the art techniques (optional)

- Deploy the model on the web and on the Jetson Nano developer kit and report the results and inference time.
